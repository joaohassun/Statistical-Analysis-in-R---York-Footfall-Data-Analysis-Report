# Statistical Analysis in R - York Footfall Data Analysis Report

This repository contains a fully reproducible RMarkdown analysis and HTML report submitted as part of a Business Statistics module in my Master's in Business Analytics. The project explores pedestrian traffic ("footfall") data in the city of York to assist a local promoter in selecting the most optimal location for placing a marketing stall.

## Project Objective

The project investigates foot traffic patterns across different locations in York using camera-based footfall data, with the goal of advising a promoter where to place their stall to maximise visibility. The analysis is divided into two parts:

---

## Part 1: Technical Statistical Analysis (For Analysts)

- **Data integrity checks** and cleaning
- **Summary statistics** per location, including:
  - First/last day of recording
  - Mean, standard deviation, max, and min footfall
- **Visualisation** of daily footfall distribution across locations
- **T-tests** comparing footfall between:
  - **Coney Street vs Stonegate (all days)**
  - **Coney Street vs Stonegate (weekends only)**
- **Technologies used:**
  - R, RMarkdown, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `broom`, `tibble`

## Part 2: Executive Summary (For Policy Makers/Managers)

- A brief, professional summary of findings presented in plain English
- Clear recommendations regarding **which location yields higher foot traffic**
  - **Week-long campaigns**
  - **Weekend-only campaigns**
- Clean, publication-ready visualisations
- Designed for decision-making audiences with limited technical background
